Ahoy, Quantum Commander! Prepare to set sail on a mind-bending voyage through the fabric of spacetime as we engage in Quantum Battleship, where uncertainty and strategy collide in an epic duel across the quantum realm. Ready your fleet and navigate the uncertain waters of superposition as we embark on a journey that defies the laws of classical warfare!

Your mission, valiant commander, is to lay waste to a fleet of 10 enemy battleships using the enigmatic weaponry of classical and quantum cannons. 
Take heed, for these are not regular battleships. They exist in states of superposition across the vast ocean.
Use the space bar to toggle between classical cannons and enigmatic quantum cannons, and press enter to unleash their fury.
(picture) Classical cannons, unveil the true nature of a single square, 
(picture) Quantum cannons shall illuminate the probabilities of four adjacent grid squares. 
Beware of the entangled battleships, for firing upon one shall unveil the destiny of its counterpart. 
To gain further insights, toggle the image on the right to reveal the intricate heat map of probabilities. 

Best of luck, intrepid commander, may your valor and determination guide you to triumph on these tumultuous quantum seas.
